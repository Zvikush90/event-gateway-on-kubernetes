# Serverless Event Gateway on Kubernetes

This guide walks you through provisioning a multi-node [Event Gateway](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway) cluster on Kubernetes. The goal of this guide is to introduce you to the Event Gateway and help you understand its role in a Serverless Architecture.

This guide will also demostrate how events can be routed across a diverse set of computing environments including Function as a Service (FaaS) offerings and containers running on Kubernetes. 

## Tutorial

This tutorial assumes you have access to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) and have enabled the [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) and [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) APIs.

## Creating a Kubernetes Cluster

The remainder of this tutorial assumes you have access to a valid Kubernetes 1.9.7+ cluster. If you are using the Google Cloud Platform you can create a Kubernetes cluster using the `gcloud` command: 

```
gcloud container clusters create event-gateway \
  --enable-autorepair \
  --cluster-version 1.9.7-gke.0 \
  --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
  --num-nodes 3 \
  --zone us-west1-c
```

## Bootstrapping an Event Gateway Cluster

In this section you will bootstrap a two node Event Gateway cluster backed by a single node etcd cluster. This deployment is only suitable for learning and demonstration purposes. This configuration is not recommend for production.

### Create an etcd Cluster

etcd is used to store and broadcast configuration across an Event Gateway cluster. A dedicated etcd cluster should be provisioned for the Event Gateway. Create the `etcd` statefulset:

```
kubectl apply -f statefulsets/etcd.yaml
```

```
statefulset "etcd" created
service "etcd" created
```

Verify the `etcd` cluster is up and running:

```
kubectl get pods
```
```
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-0    1/1       Running   0          20s
```

### Create an Event Gateway Cluster

Create the `event-gateway` deployment:

```
kubectl apply -f deployments/event-gateway.yaml
```

```
deployment "event-gateway" created
service "event-gateway" created
```

At this point the Event Gateway should be up and running and exposed via an external loadbalancer.

```
kubectl get pods
```
```
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-0                           1/1       Running   0          1m
event-gateway-5ff8554766-r7ndx   1/1       Running   0          30s
event-gateway-5ff8554766-tp87g   1/1       Running   0          30s
```

Print the `event-gateway` service details:

```
kubectl get svc event-gateway
```
```
NAME                  TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                         AGE
event-gateway         LoadBalancer   10.15.248.210   XX.XXX.XXX.XX   4000:31061/TCP,4001:32247/TCP   11m
```

> In this tutorial the Event Gateway is not protected by TLS or authentication and should only be used for learning the basics.

Get the external IP address assigned to the `event-gateway` service and store it:

```
EVENT_GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get svc \
  event-gateway \
  -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip})
```

## Routing Events to Google Cloud Functions

In this section you will deploy a Google Cloud Function which will be used to test the event routing functionality of the Event Gateway cluster. Deploy the `echo` cloud function:

```
gcloud beta functions deploy echo \
  --source echo-function \
  --trigger-http
```

Get the HTTPS URL assigned to the `echo` cloud function and store it:

```
export FUNCTION_URL=$(gcloud beta functions describe echo \
  --format 'value(httpsTrigger.url)')
```

### Register the echo Goole Cloud Function

In this section you will register the `echo` cloud function with the Event Gateway.

Create a function registration request body:

```
cat > register-function.json <<EOF
{
  "functionId": "echo",
  "type": "http",
  "provider":{
    "url": "${FUNCTION_URL}"
  }
}
EOF
```

Register the `echo` cloud function by posting the function registration to the Event Gateway:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4001/v1/spaces/default/functions \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data @register-function.json
```

At this point the `echo` cloud function has been registered with the Event Gateway, but before it can receive events a subscription must be created.

### Create a Subscription

A subscription binds an event to a function. Create an HTTP event subscription which binds the `echo` cloud function to a HTTP event:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4001/v1/spaces/default/subscriptions \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "functionId": "echo",
    "event": "http",
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/"
  }'
```

### Emit an HTTP Event

With the `echo` cloud function registered and bound to an HTTP event on the `/` HTTP request path we are ready to test our setup.

Submit an HTTP request to the Event Gateway:

```
curl -i --request POST \
  --url http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4000/ \
  --data '{"message": "Hello world!"}'
```

The `echo` cloud function will respond with the data submitted in the HTTP request:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Compute-Type: function
Date: Tue, 08 May 2018 22:16:15 GMT
Content-Length: 27
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

{"message": "Hello world!"}
```

> Notice the value of the `Compute-Type` HTTP header. It was set to `function` by the echo cloud function.

Review the Cloud Functions logs:

```
gcloud beta functions logs read echo
```

```
LEVEL  NAME  EXECUTION_ID  TIME_UTC                 LOG
D      echo  4uczimni6d70  2018-05-08 23:24:11.206  Function execution started
I      echo  4uczimni6d70  2018-05-08 23:24:11.458  Handling HTTP event 13e2cfa2-3c86-42dc-a8be-a01648b6444c
D      echo  4uczimni6d70  2018-05-08 23:24:11.546  Function execution took 341 ms, finished with status code: 200
```

## Routing Events to Kubernetes Services

In most Serverless deployments events are typically routed to functions running on a hosted FaaS platform such as [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) or [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda). However this is not a hard requirement. Using the Event Gateway events can be routed to any HTTP endpoint.

In this section you will deploy the `gcr.io/hightowerlabs/echo:event-gateway` container using Kubernetes and route HTTP events to it using the Event Gateway.

Create a `echo` Kubernetes deployment and service:

```
kubectl create -f deployments/echo.yaml
```

```
deployment "echo" created
service "echo" created
```

Register the Kubernetes `echo` service with the Event Gateway:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4001/v1/spaces/default/functions \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "functionId": "echo-service",
    "type": "http",
    "provider":{
      "url": "http://echo.default.svc.cluster.local"
    }
  }'
```

> At this point the `echo` service has been registered with the Event Gateway, but before it can receive events a subscription must be created.

There can only be one binding for a specific HTTP event mapped to a specific path and method. Before we can route events to the `echo` Kubernetes service we need to delete the subscription for the `echo` cloud function:

```
curl -X DELETE \
  http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4001/v1/spaces/default/subscriptions/http,POST,%2F
```

Next create an HTTP event subscription for the `echo-service` function:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4001/v1/spaces/default/subscriptions \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "functionId": "echo-service",
    "event": "http",
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/"
  }'
```

### Emit an event

```
curl -i --request POST \
  --url http://${EVENT_GATEWAY_IP}:4000/ \
  --data '{"message": "Hello World!"}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Compute-Type: container
Date: Tue, 08 May 2018 23:35:35 GMT
Content-Length: 27
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

{"message": "Hello World!"}
```

> Notice the value of the `Compute-Type` HTTP header. It was set to `container` by the echo service.

Review the `echo` container logs:

```
kubectl logs echo-77d48cb484-5tqdq
```

```
2018/05/08 23:30:04 Starting HTTP server...
2018/05/08 23:35:35 Handling HTTP event f3a37c57-d85a-4942-b92c-cef56713d538 ...
```
