# echo

The `echo` [cloud function](https://cloud.google.com/functions) handles [HTTP Events](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway/blob/master/docs/api.md#http-event) based on the [CloudEvent](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway/blob/master/docs/api.md#event-definition) event format and echoes the request body back to the caller.
